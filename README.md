# personal-fusion-tool-library
A custom fusion tool library containing only the tools and presets I use.
Specifically tailored for use with the Carbide3D Nomad 3 CNC.

Contains bits from
- [Whiteside](https://www.whitesiderouterbits.com/)
- [BitsBits](https://bitsbits.com/)
- [Carbide3D](https://carbide3d.com/)
- [CNCplus](https://cnc-plus.de/en/)

Where applicable, I've created presets for Wood/Plywood, MDF/Laminate, Plastic/Acrylic and Aluminium.

Initial commit is far from finished. Not all feeds&speeds have been tested and not all presets created.
